/**
 Possible response status'.

 - CKOCSPResponseStatusOK: The "good" state indicates a positive response to the status inquiry.
                           At a minimum, this positive response indicates that the certificate
                           is not revoked, but does not necessarily mean that the certificate
                           was ever issued or that the time at which the response was produced
                           is within the certificate's validity interval. Response extensions
                           may be used to convey additional information on assertions made by
                           the responder regarding the status of the certificate such as
                           positive statement about issuance, validity, etc.
 - CKOCSPResponseStatusRevoked: The "revoked" state indicates that the certificate has been revoked
                                (either permanantly or temporarily (on hold)).
 - CKOCSPResponseStatusUnknown: The "unknown" state indicates that the responder doesn't know about
                                the certificate being requested.
